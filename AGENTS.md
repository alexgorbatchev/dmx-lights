# DMX Lights

This project is dedicated to creating DMX light fixture definitions for DJ lights based on manufacturer manuals.

## Setup
- All source materials and manufacturer documentation are located in the `manuals/` directory.

## Conventions
- Rely on the original markdown and PDF manuals in the `manuals/` directory for fixture DMX channel mappings and descriptions.
- Ensure all DMX definitions perfectly match the 0-255 value ranges and channel orders specified in the manuals.
- Name fixture definition files consistently with the manual names (e.g., `LED Mini Moving Light`).

## Gotchas
- Manufacturer manuals sometimes contain typos or confusing macro channel descriptions; carefully check the value ranges (e.g., 0-10 vs 11-255).
- Some lights have multiple DMX channel modes (e.g., 14-channel vs 37-channel mode). Make sure to account for all available modes when creating definitions.

## Boundaries
- Always: double-check DMX channel numbers and value ranges against the source `manuals/*.md` documentation.
- Ask first: before guessing or inferring missing information that is not explicitly defined in the manual.
- Never: modify the source manuals in `manuals/` unless explicitly requested to correct errors or improve formatting.
